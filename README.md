## React

- This multi page App with React was an exercise for us to learn and grow our knowledge of the framework.
- React Router was implemented to give unique URLs to the movies as well as default URL handling. Rancid Tomatillos shed light on how a multi page app might work with unique URLS in the real-world.
- Compared to previous projects in VanillaJS, React maintained a sync'd state at all times, which expedited the process of displaying information accurately.

## Cypress Testing

- All Testing of User views and user interactions
- Error Handling of Server errors and invalid URLS Tested
- Fetch requests are stubbed
